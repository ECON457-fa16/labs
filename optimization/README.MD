And the algebraic formulation may seem overly complex. In practice, there are advantages to formulating linear programs in different ways. And there are huge advantages in the algebraic formulation. (One can express huge problems efficiently on a computer using a modeling language, such as Julia/JuMP, which is based on the algebraic formulation.) In addition, formulating an LP in multiple ways provides insight into the LP models.
